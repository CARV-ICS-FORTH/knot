# Knot dashboard Helm chart

[Knot](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/knot) is a complete environment for doing actual work on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). It includes a complete set of web-based tools to help you unleash your productivity, without ever needing to use the command line. At its core, the Knot dashboard supplies the landing page for users, allowing them to launch notebooks and other services, design workflows, and specify parameters related to execution through a user-friendly interface. The dashboard manages users, wires up relevant storage to the appropriate paths inside running containers, securely provisions multiple services under one externally-accessible HTTPS endpoint, while keeping them isolated in per-user namespaces at the Kubernetes level, and provides an identity service for OAuth 2.0/OIDC-compatible applications.

Check out the [README](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/knot/blob/master/README.md) and the [documentation](https://carv-ics-forth.github.io/knot/docs/) for more information and pointers to deployment instructions.

> ⚠️ **This chart is for installing the Knot dashboard only** The Knot environment is installed with [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile), which automatically installs all required software, including the Knot dashboard, using [Helm](https://helm.sh).

## Chart usage

To deploy the Knot dashboard using [Helm](https://helm.sh), first add the repo and then install. For example:

```bash
helm repo add knot https://carv-ics-forth.github.io/knot/chart
helm install knot knot/knot --namespace default \
    --set knot.stateHostPath=/mnt/knot \
    --set knot.ingressURL=https://example.com \
    --set knot.filesURL=file:///mnt/files
```

Some of the variables set above are required. The table below lists all available options:

Set `knot.filesURL` to:
* `file://<path>`, if using a node-wide, shared mountpoint for files.
* `nfs://<server>/<path>`, if using an NFS server for files.

The Knot dashboard will create `private/<username>`, `shared`, and `uploads` folders within.

The state volume is used to store the internal database. You can either use an existing peristent storage claim with `knot.stateVolumeClaim`, or set `knot.stateHostPath` to automatically create one (this must accessible by all nodes).

The theme volume is used to replace the default [theme directory](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/knot/tree/master/dashboard/static/dashboard/theme) and should contain variants of all existing files.

To remove the Knot dashboard, uninstall using `helm uninstall knot`, which will remove the service, admission webhooks, and associated RBAC rules.
