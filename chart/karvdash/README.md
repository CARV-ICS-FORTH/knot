# Karvdash Helm Chart

Karvdash (Kubernetes CARV dashboard) is a dashboard service for facilitating data science on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). It supplies the landing page for users, allowing them to launch notebooks and other services, design workflows, and specify parameters related to execution through a user-friendly interface. Karvdash manages users, wires up relevant storage to the appropriate paths inside running containers, securely provisions multiple services under one externally-accessible HTTPS endpoint, while keeping them isolated in per-user namespaces at the Kubernetes level, and provides an identity service for OAuth 2.0/OIDC-compatible applications.

Check out the [README](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/karvdash/tree/master/README.md) before deploying.

## Deployment

Karvdash is deployed using [Helm](https://helm.sh) (version 3). We use Kubernetes 1.19.x to develop, test, and run Karvdash on both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.

To install, you need a running Kubernetes environment with the following features:
* The [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) certificate management controller for Kubernetes. This is used for creating certificates automatically for the admission webhooks. We use [this](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/jetstack/cert-manager) Helm chart.
* An [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) answering to a domain name and its wildcard (i.e. both `example.com` and `*.example.com` should both point to your server). You can use [nip.io](http://nip.io) if you don't have a DNS entry. We use [this](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx) Helm chart.
* For storage of Karvdash state, an existing persistent volume claim, or a directory in a shared filesystem mounted at the same path across all Kubernetes nodes.
* For files, either a shared filesystem like the one used for storing the configuration, or an NFS server. If using an NFS server, you should also install the [NFS CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs). We use [these](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs/tree/master/charts) instructions to install via Helm.

Karvdash can run side-by-side with [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) and [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows), providing SSO services to users. For Argo Workflows, Karvdash also configures appropriate authorization directives, so each user will be allowed to access resources in the corresponding Karvdash-defined namespace. We use [this](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Helm chart for JupyterHub and [this](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm) one for Argo Workflows.

Optionally, you can also have Karvdash act as a frontend to:
* A private container registry. You can run the one from Docker using [these](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) instructions, or [this](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/twuni/docker-registry) Helm chart.
* [Datashim](https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim), in which case Karvdash can be used to configure datasets (references to objects in S3 buckets that will be mounted in user containers as files).

Our [Makefile](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/karvdash/tree/master/Makefile) deploys all the above for [local development](#Development).

To deploy Karvdash, first add the repo and then install. For example:

```bash
helm repo add karvdash https://carv-ics-forth.github.io/karvdash/chart
helm install karvdash karvdash/karvdash --namespace default \
    --set karvdash.ingressURL=https://example.com \
    --set karvdash.stateHostPath=/mnt/nfs/karvdash \
    --set karvdash.filesURL=file:///mnt/nfs
```

Set `karvdash.filesURL` to:
* `file://<path>`, if using a node-wide, shared mountpoint for files.
* `nfs://<server>/<path>`, if using an NFS server for files.

Karvdash will create `private/<username>`, `shared`, and `uploads` folders within.

The state volume is used to store the database, the running services repository, and the template library. You can either use an existing peristent storage claim with `karvdash.stateVolumeClaim`, or set `karvdash.stateHostPath` to automatically create one (this must accessible by all nodes). Create a `templates` directory inside the state volume to add new service templates or override defaults (the ones in [templates](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/karvdash/tree/master/templates)). Templates placed there will be available as read-only to all users.

The theme volume is used to replace the default [theme directory](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/karvdash/tree/master/dashboard/static/dashboard/theme) and should contain variants of all existing files.

To remove Karvdash, uninstall using `helm uninstall karvdash`, which will remove the service, admission webhooks, and RBAC rules, but not associated CRDs. You can use the YAML files in [crds](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/karvdash/tree/master/chart/karvdash/crds) to remove them.
